# üîç Final Project: Sentiment Analysis of Fan Reactions on Twitter Following Sports Results ‚öΩüìä
After five months of intensive learning, I‚Äôm proud to present my final project from the Data Science course at Dicampus, focused on analyzing social media sentiment about second-division football coaches following matches. This project delves into the fascinating field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and allowed me to explore the full Data Lifecycle üìà.

## Project Highlights
1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection
I gathered tweets about coaches in the days after each match, along with team statistics, using ETL techniques to build a comprehensive dataset.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning and Preparation
Ensuring data quality was essential for accurate analysis. I removed unnecessary symbols, mentions, hashtags, and URLs to create a clean dataset.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Sentiment Modeling
Using the VADER model, I conducted sentiment analysis to classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral. However, this required significant adjustments:

Colloquial Phrases: Phrases like "the coach won‚Äôt eat his Christmas turr√≥n here" (implying an impending dismissal) were not interpreted correctly without additional tuning.
Global Text Evaluation: VADER assigns an overall polarity score, which can misclassify mixed sentiments within complex sentences, such as, "We have the best roster but play terribly."
4Ô∏è‚É£ Correlation Analysis
As shown in the attached correlation matrix, I compared fan sentiment with sports metrics. Sentiment closely aligned with results (negative = loss) and ranking, but also with tweet volume: an increase in tweets about a coach often reflected negative sentiment. Early coaching changes often happened with teams with larger fanbases, as doubts arose quickly on social media.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Trend Analysis with Advanced Models
As a future step, I plan to analyze trend shifts using models inspired by magnetism (as outlined in a previous post) and explore solutions to counter negative sentiment trends.
